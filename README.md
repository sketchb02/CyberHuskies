## Mission
We are committed to the protection of privacy rights and personal information in the digital arena. As such, this project aims to create a Personally Identifiable Information (PII) document scanner to aid users in the protection of PII and the prevention of its unintentional dissemination or leakage.

## Scope
The final product will be a downloadable application (i.e., no internet connection required upon download) that utilizes a natural language processing algorithm to identify and flag information in user-uploaded documents that might be PII.
